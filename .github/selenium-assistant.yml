  👋 Hi there! Thank you for creating this issue.
  I am the Selenium Assistant Bot 🤖, I help maintainers triage issues in
  this repository. If I can't do it, I leave a label to help maintainers
  identify issues that need triaging.

  I am an Open Source project 🙌, post bugs or improvements ideas at
  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium-assistant!


# Is the assistant actively closing any new open issues requesting support or asking questions?
closeQuestionsAndSupportRequests: true

closeQuestionsAndSupportRequestsComment: >
  It looks like this is a request for support 💬 or a question ❓.

  💡A better way to address this is to send questions and support requests to the
  📫[Selenium user group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/selenium-users),
  to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/selenium),
  or you could join us in the 🗣[IRC/Slack channel](https://seleniumhq.herokuapp.com/)
  where the community can help you as well.

  If you think this is wrong, please feel free to open a new issue.

  Thank you for your contributions.
